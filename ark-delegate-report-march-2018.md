# Ark Delegate Report — March 2018

I guess it is time for another update about the delegate landscape of Ark. You
should check out the January edition to get the starting point of the delegate
politics.

### Private Delegates (15)

There were not much changes and we still got the same 15 private delegates in
the top 51.

* ares, arkane, arknet, bbclubark, doc, emotive_ark, forginator, hippopotamus,
kolap, pitbull, rasputin, samuray, superstar, therock, tibonos

### Special Requirement Delegates (3)

Also no changes in this category of half private and half public delegates. It
is still the same 3 delegates:

* arkx, biz_private, yin

### Team Delegates (6)

There are the following known team related delegates:

* arknet, arkx, chris, dr10, quarkpool, tibonos

I added arkx as he is doing a lot of work for the team.

### Public Delegates (33)

We got the following new delegates since January:

* arkade_delegate: running game tournaments for Ark outreach
* provolve: profit sharing, reportings and lottery
* arkoar.group: working on coding projects for Ark.
* locama: profit sharing

We lost these delegates to make room for them:

* criptodogg: lost too many votes while not forging
* doom: lost too many votes, didn’t try to gain voters
* ryano: still involved in ACES
* anamix: lost too many voters, tried to gain voters but failed

That’s the currently forging public delegates:

* arkade_delegate, arkgallery, arkland, arkmoon, arkpool, arkoar.group, arkship,
arkworld, arky, axi, bioly, biz_classic, calidelegate, chris, dafty, del, dr10,
dutchdelegate, ghostfaceuk, goose, jamiec79, jarunik, locama, pieface,
quarkpool, ozpooldelegate, provolve, ravelou, sharkark, sharkpool, thefoundry,
toad, wes

### Pure Public Pools (20)

I moved pieface and sharkark to this group as there was no obvious contribution
in the last months.

In: locama

Out: doom, criptodogg, anamix

That is the full list:

* arkgallery, arkmoon, arkpool, arkship, axi, bioly, calidelegate, del, dr10,
ghostfaceuk, jamiec79, locama, ozpooldelegate, pieface, quarkpool, ravelou,
sharkark, sharkpool, toad, wes

### Contributing Delegates (16)

We some some changes in contributing delegates in the last months.

### Competition

We saw some serious competition in the last 2 months with a lot of shifting
rankings. Some delegates dropped out of the top 51 for some time and got in
again. In the end you can sum it up that we swapped 4 public delegates for 4
other public ones.

### Sharing Ratios

I tried to gather some information about the current sharing ratios.

* There are 15 private delegates without known sharing ratios.

Sharing ranges:

* There are 5 delegates that promise to share 100%
* There are 4 delegates sharing 96%-99%
* **There are 10 delegates sharing exactly 95%**
* There are 2 delegates sharing 91%-94%
* **There are 12 delegates sharing exactly 90%**
* There are 3 delegates sharing between 80%-89%

Key figures:

* Most delegates share 90% (12) or 95% (10)
* The average sharing ratio is 93%

Intersting to note:

* There is no direct correlation between current ranking and sharing ratio.
* Sharing ratios have slightly increased compared to January
