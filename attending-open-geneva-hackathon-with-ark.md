# Attending Open Geneva Hackathon with ARK

I joined the ARK team to help in the openGeneva hackathon.

## Thursday Evening

The first small presentation was happening Thursday evening in the office of [Fusion](https://www.fusion.xyz/). They are running an Accelerator connecting Fintechs and Banks. Sal Matteis shortly introduced their networking platform and explained how they want to improve their blockchain coverage. Next on stage was FX Thoorens explaining ARK. It was a similar presentation like at ArkCon explaining blockchain and the Ark project. There was another presentation from [Prodibi](https://www.prodibi.com/) which is looking into using blockchain in their high resolution image solution. There were snacks and discussions after the presentations. I really liked the blockchain discussions.


## Friday Hackathon

The ARK team and the video crew [Samourai Coop](https://www.cooperativesamourai.com/) were walking to the University of Geneva. I shot some pictures on the way there.

I didn't want to make any pictures of the students to respect their privacy. There were multiple different hackathons running in parallel.
There was sadly only two teams who worked on an ARK project as all the students spread among different topics. But there was a lot of discussions and interest to learn more about ARK and blockchain. So I could at least explain a lot of people how ARK is working. 

FX Thoorens (CTO of ARK) also gave and interview.

All in all the Hackathon was disappointing as there were too few developers coding on top of ARK. But then I could at least talk a lot about ARK. Spending the evening with the team talking about crypto was the best part of the day. 

## Saturday Video Day

We had to complete some of the stuff at the Hackathon the next day. Afterwards we focused on producing video content.

Chris is preparing for an interview.

It was a lot of fun to produce video content for ARK. I am really curious how it will turn out.

We used the evening to brainstorm some new ideas as well. Some were good enough that we agreed to follow up on them.

After this intensive days I was happy to get the Sunday off recover.

Thanks for reading.
