# Ark Ecosystem — Frequently Asked Questions (September 2017)
There are a lot of reoccurring questions on reddit and slack. Here is a short compilation of the most important once. I will try to keep the answer short and to the point.

## How can I get Ark?
You have to buy it on an exchange. The current exchanges are:

- [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)
- [Cryptopia](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=ARK_BTC)
- [Litebit](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=ARK_BTC)
- [Coss](https://coss.io/)
- [Coinspot](https://www.coinspot.com.au/buy/ark)
- [Coinswitch](https://www.coinswitch.co/)

The current main exchange is Bittrex. You will have to buy Bitcoin (BTC) first and send it to Bittrex. After that you can trade your BTC for Ark.

## What do I do with this passphrase ?
The passphrase is the master password for your coins. You have to secure the passphrase in order to keep control over your wallet. With the passphrase you can sign transactions to send your Ark. Do not lose it and do not share it with others or you will lose your coins.

## I can’t send a transaction because of a wrong passphrase. What should I do?
You can’t do anything without the correct passphrase. Please be aware that every character and space counts. Try to remove spaces at the beginning and end. Try to check wrong capital letters. Try to spot wrongly written words. If you do not have the correct passphrase … your coins are lost.

## I can’t send a transaction because of some time stamp thing. What should i do?
Please synchronize your computer time with the internet. You can google guides how to do that for every OS.

## My bittrex withdrawal does not work. Why?
You most likely forgot to confirm the withdrawal. Please check your emails. If it still did not work you should contract bittrex support.

## Can I vote from an exchange?
No. You need to send the Ark to the desktop wallet in order to vote.

How can I find and chose a delegate?
The best places to find delegate information are:

<https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkDelegates/>

<https://forum.ark.io/category/5/delegates>

## How much profit will I get from voting?
You can check profit approximations in one of the calculators:

## How much Ark do I need to vote?
The fee to register your vote is currently 1 Ark. Your remaining balance will decide how much profits you will make. Please check profit sharing calculators. Then you can estimate how long it takes to gain back the fee. It is important to check the delegates proposals. Some do have requirements that you need to fulfill in order to get rewards. Some also deduct the transaction fee to pay out the profit from your profit share. If you can find a good delegate it makes sense to vote even with around 100 Ark. But the entire voting system is subject to the ever changing delegate market. Please educate yourself before voting.

## Is voting a risk for my wallet?
No. All you can loose is the 1 Ark voting fee. All other coins will stay in your wallet and you have full control over them. Please do not send coins to delegates! That will not count as vote and you might lose your coins.

## How can I change my vote?
You can remove the vote registration from a delegate (unvote). Then you best restart the desktop client and vote for the delegate of your choice.

## Can I vote for multiple delegates?
You can only vote one delegate from one wallet. If you want to support multiple delegates you will have to create more wallets and split up your funds.

## Do i have to re-vote when I receive additional coins in my wallet?
No. The vote contribution will automatically adapt to your wallet balance.

How much do the different transactions cost?
- Send Transaction: 0.1 Ark
- Vote: 1 Ark
- Unvote: 1 Ark
- Register second passphrase: 5 Ark
- Register a delegate: 25 Ark

## Why do I need a second passphrase?
The second passphrases will improve security by adding another 12 words that are needed to control your wallet.

## What use have these “Offline” folders in the wallet?
You can use the offline folders to split-up your funds within a wallet. This allows you to better manage your Ark without paying any fee. The splitup is local to your computer and not stored on the blockchain.
