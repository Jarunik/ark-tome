# How to add another Ark based coin to the Ark Desktop Client?

It is possible to clone the Ark blockchain and launch your own coin with it.
This article will explain how to use the Ark Desktop Client for such a clone
chain based on the Ark code. Just having a clone chain without an application to
send coins is not much fun after all.

Here is my guide to launch your own clone chain:

This guide is also useful if you do not create your own clone chain as there are
already some clone chains live.

Known Ark based chains which are compatible with the Ark Desktop client:

1.  Blockpool — [https://blockpool.io](https://blockpool.io/)
1.  Kapu —[ ](about:invalid#zSoyz)[https://kapu.one/](https://kapu.one/)
1.  Devnet — Testing Network for Ark
1.  Mainnet — The one you have been using all the time

You could download their wallets to use these blockchains. But you can also use
the Ark Desktop Client and add a new custom Token to it. The next steps will
explain how to add a second Ark Mainnet to the Desktop Client.

#### Launch the Desktop Client

#### Enter a Name and a Seed Server

<span class="figcaption_hack">Enter a Seed Server</span>

The Seed Server for Ark Mainnet to copy & paste:

[http://5.39.9.240:4001](http://5.39.9.240:4001/)

You can choose another seed if you want to add another coin.

You can choose any name you want.

#### Save the Network

Additional parameters of the network will be automatically loaded from the seed
server.

#### Switch Network

Now that you have multiple networks you can switch between them.

#### Use the new Network and Coin

<span class="figcaption_hack">New Network</span>

You can now use the new network and import or create accounts. As you can see I
created another Ark mainnet. This means you can also use this feature to create
different “work-spaces” with different accounts for the same coin.

#### Remove the Network to clean up

You can also remove the additional networks which you do not need anymore.

#### Limitations

Please be aware that the current client does have hard-coded fees. This means
that you might end up paying too high fees if you use the Ark Desktop Client for
some coins with other fee structures.

#### Conclusion

It is really easy to use the Ark Desktop Client for other coins.

Here are the current interesting Seed Servers:

1.  Blockpool Mainnet: [http://13.56.163.57:9031](http://13.56.163.57:9031/)
1.  Kapu Mainnet: [http://51.15.198.173:4600](http://51.15.198.173:4600/)
1.  Ark Devnet: [http://167.114.29.55:4002](http://167.114.29.55:4002/)
1.  Ark Mainnet: [http://5.39.9.240:4001](http://5.39.9.240:4001/)

Please check for a updated Seed Servers if these are not working anymore.

I hope that gave you some new ideas.
